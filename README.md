### **Project Proposal: Parallel Punctuation Analyzer**

#### **1. Project Name**

**PunctuationAnalyzer**

#### **2. Team Members & Team Name**

Rui Li, Junhan Hao
Team Name: P.B group

#### **3. Problem Statement**

Analyze the frequency and distribution patterns of punctuation usage across large volumes of text files

Assist linguists, writers, and editors in understanding punctuation conventions within writing styles

#### **4. Project Goals**

Implementing a High-Performance Punctuation Analysis System

Supports processing text data at the GB/TB level

#### **5. Parallel Computing Solution**

1. Multithreading Processing (File Level)
2. Distributed Systems (Large Datasets)

   Distribute massive text files across multiple computing nodes

   Each node independently compiles punctuation statistics for local files

   Master node aggregates statistical results from all nodes
