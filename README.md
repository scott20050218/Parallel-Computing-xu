### **Project Proposal: Parallel Place ~~（Punctuation）~~ Analyzer**

#### **1. Project Name**

**PlaceAnalyzer ~~（PunctuationAnalyzer）~~**

#### **2. Team Members & Team Name**

Rui Li, Junhan Hao
Team Name: P.B group

#### **3. Problem Statement**

Analyze the frequency and distribution patterns of Place ~~punctuation~~ usage across large volumes of history text files

The Relationship Between Geographic Coordinates and History

#### **4. Project Goals**

Implementing a High-Performance Place ~~Punctuation~~ Analysis System

Supports processing text data at the GB/TB level

#### **5. Parallel Computing Solution**

1. Multithreading Processing (File Level)
2. Distributed Systems (Large Datasets)

   Distribute massive text files across multiple computing nodes

   Each node independently compiles Place ~~Punctuation~~ statistics for local files

   Master node aggregates statistical results from all nodes
